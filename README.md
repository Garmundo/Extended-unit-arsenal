# Extended-unit-arsenal

(Status: UPDATING)

8 new "cruiser-class" units (revenant variant)
2 new "capitals" (along with lich and reaper factories)
and 2 powerful "mothership" class destroyers are added into 
mindustry. All require the vanilla resources and have sprites which 
resemble the vanilla art style making this mod a simple extension of 
the unit arsenal without breaking the original vanilla experience.

2 new heavy land units.

(if you want to play around with the units in sandbox
I recommend increasing unit production
speed in custom settings or downloading infinitodustry and using the 
overjector because capital ship production time
is SLOW)
